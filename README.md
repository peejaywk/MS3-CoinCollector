# Coin Collector
Coin Collector is a website for people who collect coins that are in everyday circulation within the UK. These could be coins found from the change in your 
pocket to coins traded / purchased on online auction sites. The site maintains a database of coins currently in circulation within the UK and allows the user 
to record what coins they have in their collection. Users can be granted admin access if they would like to contribute / add coins to the database.

*NOTE: The initial release of the website will focus on the UK fifty pence piece and two pound coin as these are the most popular coins for collectors as 
they have had many variations on design over the years.*

The main aims of the website are:
* Allow users to record coins they have collected and coins on their wish list
* Maintain a database of coins currently in circulation within the UK
* Display statistics on a user’s collection
* Be responsive so the website works across all devices / screen sizes

### Wireframe Mockups

The website is split into several pages allowing the user to manage/view their coin collection and allowing administrators to add/edit coins. 
Initial design ideas were captured using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - these are linked below:

## Database Design

The website uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the backend database. The database for this site consists of five collections. The relationships between these collections
are documented in the tables below and also illustrated graphically in the pdf diagram linked below. The design of the database went through several itterations and these can be 
found in the /assets/documetation folder of the repository.

devices and screen sizes.

### Deploying to Heroku

To delpoy the appllication to Heroku follow the instructions below. This process assumes you are using the GitPod development environment.

1. Open a terminal window and type in the following command to create a requirments.txt file. This file contains a list of applications and 
dependencies required to run our application.

pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

2. In the terminal type in the following command to create a Procfile. The Procfile is used to tell Heroku how to run the application

echo web: python app.py > Procfile

3. Save these files and commit/push them to GitHub.

4. 


Setting up GitPod environment
Install Flask
pip3 install Flask

Install pymongo to allow Flask to communication with our Mongo database
pip3 install flask-pymongo

Install dnspython so the Mongo SRV connection string can be used
pip3 install dnspython



Install boto3 AWS SDK
pip3 install boto3



Bugs

Chrome autofill changes the background to a different colour on the coin add form. A solution implemented in the CSS file was found here.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2781549/removing-input-background-colour-for-chrome-autocomplete

Pagination links not working when searching for an item. 
In the app.py file was using 'query = request.form.get("query")' to get the search query retruned a null search string when the pagination link was pressed
to move to the next window. Fixed this by changing the line of code to 'query = request.args.get("query")' to get the value via the arguments. This passed 
in the correct search term.
