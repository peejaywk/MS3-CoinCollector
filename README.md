Coin Collector is a website for people who collect coins that are in everyday circulation within the UK. These could be coins found from the change in your 
pocket to coins traded / purchased on online auction sites. The site maintains a database of coins currently in circulation within the UK and allows the user 
to record what coins they have in their collection. Users can be granted admin access if they would like to contribute / add coins to the database.

*NOTE: The initial release of the website will focus on the UK fifty pence piece and two pound coin as these are the most popular coins for collectors as 
they have had many variations on design over the years.*

The main aims of the website are:
* Allow users to record coins they have collected and coins on their wish list
* Maintain a database of coins currently in circulation within the UK
* Display statistics on a user’s collection
* Be responsive so the website works across all devices / screen sizes

### Wireframe Mockups

The website is split into several pages allowing the user to manage/view their coin collection and allowing administrators to add/edit coins. 
Initial design ideas were captured using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - these are linked below:

* [Home Page - Logged In](/assets/wireframes/002-HomePage-LoggedIn-v2.png)
* [Want List Page](/assets/wireframes/003-WantList-v2.png)
* [Add/Edit Coin Page](/assets/wireframes/004-Add_EditCoinPage-v1.png)
* [Admin Page](/assets/wireframes/005-AdminPage-v2.png)

<a name="database"></a>
## Database Design

The website uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the backend database. The database for this site consists of five collections. The relationships between these collections
are documented in the tables below and also illustrated graphically in the pdf diagram linked below. The design of the database went through several iterations and these can be 
found in the /assets/documentation folder of the repository.

NOTE: It was decided to remove the dedicated admin page as other pages could be reused but with different buttons being rendered for when an administrator is logged in.

### Frontend Design
The [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) framework was used to implement the frontend of the website to give a responsive design that provides a good UX across all
devices and screen sizes.

### User Registration/Authentication
To use the website users must register an account providing their name, email address and password. The password is hashed before being written to the database. To login the 
user must enter their email address and password.
NOTE: If a user requires administrator access this must be granted by the website owner.

### Database Interactions
* Regular users can view/search all the coins in the database.
* Regular users can select a coin to add to their collection with custom notes and a 'found' date.
* Regular users can edit any coin in their collection to modify the custom notes or 'found' date.
* Regular users can remove a coin from their collection.
* Regular users can select a coin to be added to their wish list.
* Regular usres can remove a coin from their wishlist.
* Admin users can view/search all the coins in the database.
* Admin users can add a new coin to the database.
* Admin users can edit a coin in the database.
* Admin users can delete a coin from the database.

### Colour Palette
A dark theme was chosen for the website to complement the bright silver/gold colours of the coins that will be displayed. All buttons on the site use the built-in colour
classes provided by Materialize. The custom colours used to style the rest of the site are detailed below:

* ![#101E30](https://via.placeholder.com/15/101E30/000000?text=+) #101E30
    * Background
    * Modal Background
* ![#DDDDDD](https://via.placeholder.com/15/dddddd/000000?text=+) #DDDDDD
    * Paragraph Text
    * Nav Links
    * Table Text
* ![#4078C0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/4078C0/000000?text=+) #4078C0       
    * Headings
    * Nav Background
    * Footer Background
    * Card Reveal
* Buttons use the built in Materialize colours

### Features Not Implemented

* For the initial release of the website it was decided not to add any functions that allow users to display statistics on their collection. This will
be added when there is more data that can be used for gathering statistics such as price paid, current estimated price etc.

### Future Features

Below are features that could be added in the future to improve the user experience and to attract more users.

* Expand the database to allow coins from all over the world to be added.
* Allow the user to record more data such as:
    * Price paid
    * Location found
    * Duplicate coins
    * Coins for sale
    * Coin condition
    * Coin type (Circulated, Silver Proof, Gold Proof etc.)
* Ability to share wishlists with other users.
* Improve the process of adding new coins to the database. Have default templates for different coins so the administrator can select a coin from
a pre-defined list. This will save a lot of typing in duplicate information such as material type, thickness, weight etc.
* Add a more sophisticated search bar to allow filtering/ordering of search results.

        * circulation
        * coins
        * denominations
        * users
        * wishlists
    * Inside the denominations collection create the following two documents:

    name | Fifty Pence | string

    Key | Value | Type
    ----|-----------|------------
    name | Two Pound | string

* [Amazon AWS Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/)

    Amazon AWS is used to host the coin images uploaded by users. Login the AWS and create a new Amazon S3 Bucket.

* [Google Mail Account](https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB/gmail/about/#)

    This is the email account used to receive any queries made via the Contact Us page.

    * To setup the Gmail account please follow the instructions posted [here](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C7JQY2RHC/p1611678109168400) on Slack.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone this [repository](https://github.com/peejaywk/MS3-CoinCollector) follow the instruction below:

1. Navigate to the [repository](https://github.com/peejaywk/MS3-CoinCollector).

2. Click on the **Code** button and copy the URL from the **Clone>>HTTPS** section.

3. Inside your development environment/IDE open a command terminal.

4. Create / navigate to the directory you would like the cloned copy to be made.

5. Type in the following command using the URL copied from step 2 and press Enter. This will create a cloned copy of the repository.

dependencies required to run our application.

        pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

2. In the terminal type in the following command to create a Procfile. The Procfile is used to tell Heroku how to run the application

        echo web: python app.py > Procfile

3. Save these files and **commit/push** them to GitHub.

4. Create an account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and **Login**.

5. From the dashboard click in the **New** button and select **Create New App** from the dropdown.
