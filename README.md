# Coin Collector
Coin Collector is a website for people who collect coins that are in everyday circulation within the UK. These could be coins found from the change in your 
pocket to coins traded / purchased on online auction sites. The site maintains a database of coins currently in circulation within the UK and allows the user 
to record what coins they have in their collection. 

*NOTE: The initial release of the website will focus on the UK fifty pence piece and two pound coin as these are the most popular coins for collectors as 
they have had many variations on design over the years.*

The main aims of the website are:
* Allow users to record coins they have collected and coins on their wish list
* Maintain a database of coins currently in circulation within the UK
* Display statistics on a user’s collection
* Be responsive so the website works across all devices / screen sizes
